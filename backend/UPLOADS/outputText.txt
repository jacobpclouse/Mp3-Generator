Itâ€™s Up To Me

I get discouraged now and then
When there are clouds of gray,
Until I think about the things
That happened yesterday.

I do not mean the day before
Or those of months ago,
But all the yesterdays in which
I had the chance to grow.

I think of opportunities
That I allowed to die,
And those I took advantage of
Before they passed me by.
And I remember that the past
Presented quite a plight,
But somehow I endured it and
The future seemed all right.
And I remind myself that I

Am capable and free,
And my success and happiness
Are really up to me.
