Item #: SCP-7179
Object Class: Safe

‘Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-7179 is unable
to be accessed or witnessed through non-anomalous means,
containment is not required.

Description: SCP-7179 refers to an unknown number of
cubic extradimensional spaces, measuring approximately
10km on each edge. Upon any human's death, their
consciousness is transported to an instance of SCP-7179,
where they will physically remanifest in the same state as they
were upon death, except in perfect health. Based on limited
‘observation and experimentation, there are no known cases of
human death where the consciousness does not appear in an
SCP-7179,

 

Aside from insignificant differences between each of them, instances of SCP-7179 are functionally identical. Each space is.
‘an oceanic environment with a single tropical island in the center. The environment of the space remains at a consistent,
‘temperature: one which is of adequate comfort to the deceased individual. Furthermore, SCP-7179 instances never display
stormy or otherwise violent weather, and the sun perpetually remains directly above the island, leaving it in eternal daytime.
As there seems to be no natural wind in SCP-7179, there is no natural water activity either. Individuals attempting to leave an
‘SCP-7179 instance simply end up on the opposite edge of the same space, with SCP-7179 acting as a functional omnilock.
Additionally, the passage of time within SCP-7179 is highly inconsistent with that of baseline reality.

Plant life in SCP-7179 bears several different species of edible, tropical fruits. Other fruits of unknown species are also
present which are analogous to substances such as alcohol, methamphetamine, and cocaine. Animal life includes several
varieties of tropical birds, butterflies, and a few instances of domestic pigs.

(On the coast of each island is a beach house which contains various amenities and furniture for sustainable living. Each
house is home to up to three human beings of sexual preference to the inhabitant; these beings seemingly bear no will of
their own and are completely loyal to the deceased, but are otherwise completely identical to normal humans. Injuries
suffered by humans within SCP-7179 heal at a normal rate, although death is impossible; seemingly fatal injuries are thus
recoverable, albeit quite painfully.
