Special Containment Procedures: Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to approach
SCP-2316. Observation of SCP-2316 must only be carried out by remote dummy probes utilizing
video and audio recording equipment. Only those personnel adequately rated for exposure to
cognitohazardous anomalies may review footage and audio of SCP-2316.

The lake in which SCP-2316 is located has been quarantined and fenced off, and is to be routinely
patrolled by individuals who have not been exposed to SCP-2316, and have no prior knowledge of
its characteristics. You do not recognize the bodies in the water. Individuals who attempt to bypass
the enforced quarantine must be apprehended and moved to Site-33 for a full cognitive influence
screening. Individuals who come within 50m of the lake containing SCP-2316 are to be considered
lost.

microphone:

   

I do not recognize the bodies in the water.
